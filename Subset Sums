Given a list arr of N integers, return sums of all subsets in it.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {2, 3}
Output:
0 2 3 5
Explanation:
When no elements is taken then Sum = 0.
When only 2 is taken then Sum = 2.
When only 3 is taken then Sum = 3.
When element 2 and 3 are taken then 
Sum = 2+3 = 5.




def subsetSums(N, arr):
    subsets = []
    for i in range(1 << N):  # Generate all possible subsets using binary representation
        subset = []
        for j in range(N):
            if (i & (1 << j)) != 0:
                subset.append(arr[j])
        subsets.append(subset)
    
    sums = [sum(subset) for subset in subsets]
    return sorted(sums)

# Example usage
N = 2
arr = [2, 3]
result = subsetSums(N, arr)
print(*result)
